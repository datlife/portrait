# Google Portrait Mode

This project aims to reproduce the technical details of how Google's Portrait Mode Camera works. Fortunately, they generously published their research ideas on the following blog posts:

* [1] Semantic Image Segmentation with DeepLab in TensorFlow.  https://research.googleblog.com/2018/03/semantic-image-segmentation-with.html
* [2] Mobile Real-time Video Segmentation. https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/mobile-real-time-video-segmentation.html

In addition, their official implementation is avaiable here: 
* DeepLab: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab

This project does not mean to "re-invent the wheel", rather an exercise for me to comprehend their ideas better through actually coding myself.
